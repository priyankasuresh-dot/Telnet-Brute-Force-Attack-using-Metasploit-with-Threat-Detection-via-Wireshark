# Telnet-Brute-Force-Attack-using-Metasploit-with-Threat-Detection-via-Wireshark
This project demonstrates a brute-force attack on a Telnet service using Metasploit, a penetration testing framework. The goal is to understand how brute-force attacks work, how attackers can exploit weak Telnet credentials, and how to monitor and detect such attacks using a network analysis tool like Wireshark.
